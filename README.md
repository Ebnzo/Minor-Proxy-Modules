# Minor Proxy Modules
A collection of the random ass modules made for logging/fun/in process of making other modules/qol. Aka a miscellaneous folder. Some of these are untested and should not even be shared or used. Nothing in this folder seeks to be useful for end users/have better alternative elsewhere already, so there is no point to use anything here. 

Each folder is a unique module in itself. Each folder should have its own readme as well

## Untested modules
Some of these modules have little to no testings at all, and is just a place for me to backup my small modules/dump my work-in-progress modules in case anything gets erased from my pc. I don't recommend using untested ones unless you can read the codes and make sure nothing will break on your end, which i will not guarantee for those folders, neither will i provide any support to fix anything in this folder. These are marked with (untested) tags beside the foldername.

None of these modules would be particularly useful, or have their own version available in other gits already. I ask that you do not share untested modules from this folder because it might break things for other people, unless you are sure it will not break anything.
