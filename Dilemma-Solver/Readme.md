# Dilemma-solver
Just a simple coinflip and dice rolling module to workout your dilemma with

Made this for fun cuz NA was down for maint. and I was bored.

Commands:

Server message:
- !coin- Flip coin
- !dice- Roll a dice from 1-100 (Similar to rolling for loots lul)

To announce it in the same chat:

Add 'announce' after !dice or !coin to announce it in the same chat you typed the commands in. This can be seen by anyone on the same chat!!!!!! (eg '!coin announce' in party chat announces the coin roll in party chat)

I am not responsible if you get reported for using announce function of this module, it will be seen by anyone in that chat if u type '!coin' or '!dice' and 'announce' together in any combinations (coin announce won't output the roll tho, you need the ! mark).
